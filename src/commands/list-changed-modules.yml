      Each row represents a space-separated list of the root directories for modules, each of which must has own `.circleci/config.yml`.

      The subsequent items, if there are any, will also be added to the filtered list of modules if there are any changes in the directory specified as the first item.

      CAVEAT: Directory names having white spaces cannot be specified.
