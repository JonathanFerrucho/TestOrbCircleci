      Directories which should be built upon changes.
      Each row represents a space-separated list of the root directories for modules, each of which must has own `.circleci/config.yml`.
      The first item of the list will be tested for changes, and will be added to the filtered list of modules if there are any changes.
      The subsequent items, if there are any, will also be added to the filtered list of modules if there are any changes in the directory specified as the first item.

      CAVEAT: Directory names having white spaces cannot be specified.
